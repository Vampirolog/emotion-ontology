Build instructiond for emmontoweb / emontotag v1

To generate a WAR file:

Install Java, Jython and Django on Jython.

Make sure the mysql connector jar in the libs directory is on the java 
classpath:
export CLASSPATH=/path/to/mysqlconnector-5.whatever.jar

cd into the emmontoweb directory and run:
jython manage.py war --include-java-libs=$CLASSPATH --context-root=emontotag

emontotag.war will be generated in the parent directory.

Follow the installation instructions now.


Instructions for how to use my insert and grabber scripts will follow 
eventually.

They're fairly self explanatory, except the one to get data from the ontology.
That one requires you to build the ontology and put the bioontology folder and 
all the libs on the classpath for jython.
