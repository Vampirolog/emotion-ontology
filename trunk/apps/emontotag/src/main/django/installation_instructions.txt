*** Installation instructions for EmOntoTag v1 ***

Set up a mysql database on localhost and port 3306 (default).
Create a database "emontotag" and a user "emontotaguser" with all privileges
for that database.

db name: emontotag
username: emontotaguser
password: stoicBananaElephant

If the database "emontotag" already exists, drop it and make a new one.

Access the mysql prompt in the emontotag database:

  $ mysql -u emontotaguser -p emontotag
  Enter password: 
  mysql > source sql1.txt

This will populate the database with all the data needed by the application.

Host the static file style.css at "/smedia/style.css" on your server.

Deploy emontotag.war. If the server runs out of memory during deployment, 
restart it and start again.

Everything should work :-)

Good luck!
